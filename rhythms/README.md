# Collection of Rhythms

Each file is named by the pattern of the rhythm and file extension `.md`, for instance [`x--x--x-.md`](x--x--x-.md) for tresillo rhythm. The file can contain arbitrary text in Markdown syntax, optionally preceeded by a YAML header demarcated by three dashes (`---`) on either end.

The text may reference other rhythms with this syntax: `` `|x-xx|` `` (pattern enclosed in `` `| `` and `` |` ``).

## Example

~~~yaml
---
name: tresillo
wikidata: Q65089548
---

Propably the most common, non-trivial rhythm.
