# Theory of Rhythms

*This page has just been started and will be updated soon.*

A rhythm is a repeated pulsation, a string of evenly spaced pulses, some of which are sounded (beats) while other are silent (rests) [@Toussaint2013, p. 5]

There are 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> possible rhythms in a sequence of _n_ pulses, but some of these are more interesting then others.

Rhythms can be equivalent or normalized:

- when rotated (this is always possible for $n>1$)
- when inflated
- when repetitions are cut

## How many core rhythms exist?

The total number of **core rythms** is the number of *aperiodic composition of the number of pulses with more than one part*. So this number of interesting, individual rhythms is almost identical to [A000740](https://oeis.org/A00740):

pulses | combinations | core rhythms 
------:|-------------:|-------------:
1 | 2 | 1 
2 | 4 | 0
3 | 8 | 1
4 | 16 | 2
5 | 32 | 14
6 | 64 | 27?
7 | 128 | 27?
8 | 256 | 62?
