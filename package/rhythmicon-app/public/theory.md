# Theory of Rhythms

*This page has just been started and will be updated soon.*

A rhythm is a repeated pulsation, a string of evenly spaced pulses, some of which are sounded (beats) while other are silent (rests) [@Toussaint2013, p. 5]

There are 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> possible rhythms in a sequence of _n_ pulses, but some of these are more interesting then others.
